# Neural Network in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network in Python using NumPy. The neural network includes feedforward and backpropagation functionalities.

## Features

- **Feedforward**: Computes the output of the neural network given input data.
- **Backpropagation**: Updates the weights and biases of the neural network based on the error between predicted and target values.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
